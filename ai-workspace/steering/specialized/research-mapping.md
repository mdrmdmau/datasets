# 🗺️ Research Mapping Framework - AI Steering

## 1. Problem Space Mapping
```
You are a research strategist. Help me map the problem space systematically:

FRAMEWORK:
1. SCOPE DEFINITION
   - What is the exact research question?
   - What are the boundaries and constraints?
   - What is NOT included in this study?

2. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
   - Who are the primary beneficiaries?
   - Who are the secondary stakeholders?
   - What are their needs and pain points?

3. RESOURCE LANDSCAPE
   - What data sources are available?
   - What tools and methods can be applied?
   - What are the resource limitations?

4. IMPACT PATHWAYS
   - How will results be used?
   - What are the potential applications?
   - How do we measure success?

## 2. Data Ecosystem Mapping
```
You are a data architect. Map the data ecosystem for this research:

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:
1. DATA INVENTORY
   - Primary sources (what we have)
   - Secondary sources (what we can access)
   - Missing data (what we need)

2. DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
   - Completeness, accuracy, timeliness
   - Bias and representation issues
   - Validation requirements

3. DATA RELATIONSHIPS
   - How datasets connect
   - Dependencies and hierarchies
   - Integration challenges

4. DATA FLOW DESIGN
   - Collection → Processing → Analysis → Output
   - Quality checkpoints
   - Feedback loops

Focus on: [SPECIFIC DATASET/DOMAIN]
```

## 3. Methodology Mapping
```
You are a research methodologist. Design the optimal research approach:

METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK:
1. RESEARCH PARADIGM
   - Quantitative vs Qualitative vs Mixed
   - Exploratory vs Confirmatory
   - Cross-sectional vs Longitudinal

2. METHOD SELECTION
   - Data collection methods
   - Analysis techniques
   - Validation approaches

3. WORKFLOW DESIGN
   - Sequential steps
   - Parallel processes
   - Decision points and iterations

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - Reliability measures
   - Validity checks
   - Bias mitigation strategies
