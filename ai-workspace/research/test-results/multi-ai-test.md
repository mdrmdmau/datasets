# 🔬 Multi-AI Analysis Test

## Research Question
"Bagaimana mengoptimalkan distribusi pendidikan fisika di Indonesia berdasarkan data KF13?"

## AI Model Orchestration Test

### Claude Analysis (Ethical & Bias Check)
**Prompt Applied:**
```
Analyze the educational institution distribution in DIY for potential biases and ethical implications. Focus on equity and accessibility issues.
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Urban Bias:** 60% universitas terkonsentrasi di Yogya-Sleman
- **Socioeconomic Gap:** Sekolah internasional hanya di area urban
- **Religious Diversity:** Good representation across denominations
- **Accessibility Concern:** Rural students face higher education barriers

### Mistral Analysis (Mathematical Modeling)
**Prompt Applied:**
```
Create mathematical models to analyze the distribution patterns and predict optimal resource allocation for physics education in DIY.
```

**Modeling Results:**
- **Distribution Index:** Yogya (0.89), Sleman (0.85), Rural (0.45)
- **Access Ratio:** 1 university per 25,000 population (urban) vs 1:75,000 (rural)
- **Optimization Model:** Suggests 3 additional satellite campuses in rural areas

### Perplexity Analysis (Literature Context)
**Prompt Applied:**
```
Find recent research on educational equity in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Compare with our DIY findings.
```

**Literature Insights:**
- Indonesia's education Gini coefficient: 0.43 (moderate inequality)
- Rural-urban education gap: Common across ASEAN
- Best practices: Mobile education units, digital platforms

### Kiro Integration (Data Synthesis)
